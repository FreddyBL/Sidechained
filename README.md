# Sidechained
Audio plugin written in C++ with the JUCE framework that allows you to sidechain audio with a customizable UI envelope and different time intervals.

# Plugin demo on Fl Studio:

This is a beat I produced/wrote using the plugin, you can clearly hear the sidechaining compression effect by the pumping sound on the subbass and the other instruments with a quarter note interval.
